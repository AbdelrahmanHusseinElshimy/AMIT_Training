The error bars function is used as a graphical optimization that depicts the variance of data plotted on a Cartesian graph. 
Error bars can be applied to graphs to provide an additional layer of detail to the data presented.

Error bars help you determine the estimated error or uncertainty to give a general idea of ​​how accurate the measurement is using the marks on the original graph 
and its data points. To visualize these information error bars, working by plotting lines extending from the center of the plotted data point or the edge using 
bar charts, the length of the error bar helps reveal the uncertainty in the data point.

Error bars always run parallel to a quantity from the scale axis so that they can be displayed either vertically or horizontally depending on whether 
the quantitative scale is on the y axis or the x axis if there are two scales and two pairs of arrow bars can be used for both axes.
